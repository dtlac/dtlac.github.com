# **Welcome to my scientific journey!**
## **About me**
I completed my Bachelor’s in Biotechnology at the University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At the time, I focused on biomaterials and their applications in drug delivery systems.
During my Master’s in Biology at Georgia State University, I studied the microbiome in blue-banded goby fish.
I have been studying the role of heat shock proteins HSP90 in the macroscopic adaptation of snowflake yeast through an evolutionary replay experiment.
